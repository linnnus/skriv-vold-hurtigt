## Problems
* clean up css
	- polyfill for var()
	- change direction in dropdown
* fix popups.
* sometimes i manage to escape, so space doesnt get preventDefualt()ed - after using navbar?
* this.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode is fkn dsigusting; fix it

## Features
* add some way of previewing what lessons train what - preffereably by lighting up keyboard
* give lessons id? - det virker lidt overkill, men det er vel en god vane?
* tilføj hastighedstest
* scroll back to game when a key is pressed - might damage performance?
* could probably optimise with set/map - especially those that happen for every keypress
* might want to remove darkening of buttons when pressed; you dont really noticit it
so it just kinda becomes a disturbance
